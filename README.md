SPRING FRAMEWORK

The Spring Framework is an application framework and inversion of control container for the Java platform. 
The framework's core features can be used by any Java application, but there are extensions for building web 
applications on top of the Java EE platform. Although the framework does not impose any specific programming model,
it has become popular in the Java community as an alternative to, replacement for, or even addition to the Enterprise
JavaBeans (EJB) model. The Spring Framework is open source.

MAVEN

Apache Maven is a software project management and comprehension tool. Based on the concept of a project object model (POM), Maven can manage a project's build, reporting and documentation from a central piece of information.

MONGODB

MongoDB (from humongous) is a cross-platform document-oriented database. Classified as a NoSQL database, MongoDB eschews the traditional table-based relational database structure in favor of JSON-like documents with dynamic schemas (MongoDB calls the format BSON), making the integration of data in certain types of applications easier and faster. Released under a combination of the GNU Affero General Public License and the Apache License, MongoDB is free and open-source software.

BOOTSTRAP

It contains HTML- and CSS-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation and other interface components, as well as optional JavaScript extensions. It aims to ease the development of dynamic websites and web applications.

DEPENDENCY INJECTION

In software engineering, dependency injection is a software design pattern that implements inversion of control for resolving dependencies. An injection is the passing of a dependency (a service or software module) to a dependent object (a client). The service is made part of the client's state. Passing the service to the client, rather than allowing a client to build or find the service, is the fundamental requirement of the pattern.
